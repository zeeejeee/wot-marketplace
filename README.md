## How to run
This project requires the installation of Node.js and NPM to work.

After installing Node.js and NPM, you can install all the other needed dependencies, build the backend and frontend, and run the server using a single command:
```bash
cd backend && npm run serve
```

It should be noted that a configuration file is also needed.
